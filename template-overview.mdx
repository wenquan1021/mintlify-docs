**Template Type**

On the Template page, you will see two main categories at the top: Meeting Templates and Note Templates.

Meeting Templates are used for meeting summaries and meeting outputs. Note Templates are used for voice notes and text notes. Although they belong to different modules, these two types of templates support syncing. This gives you flexibility to reuse structures across different workflows.

**Layout: template list and overview**

The Template page is divided into two sections.

On the left side, you will see the template list. You can collapse categories you do not need, which helps keep your workspace clean and focused. On the right side, you will see the template overview.

When you select a template, the overview panel shows its instruction and included sections. Under the template title, you will see tags. “By Mumble” indicates a prebuilt template created by Mumble AI.
