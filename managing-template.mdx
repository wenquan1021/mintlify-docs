Templates can be customized, previewed and prioritized based on your workflow.

**Editing**

All existing templates can be customized. You can modify their content, category, and order at any time.

- Category can be changed or added using the dropdown under the template title.
- The order of templates and categories can be adjusted in the left template list. You can drag and drop templates to reorder them or move them into a different category.
- Each section and the template instruction can be edited directly in the input fields on the right. You can also select specific text and use your shortcut for voice edit to quickly update the content.

**Preview**

If you want to see how a template works before using it, click Preview in the bottom right corner.

In the preview page, you can generate output using either a built in sample from Mumble AI or your own notes. This helps you understand how the final result will look in real scenarios.
