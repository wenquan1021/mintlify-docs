Mumble is a voice-first AI workspace that captures your ideas and meetings without any context switching. You speak, and Mumble instantly turns everything into organized notes, summaries, and calendar events.

**The problem Mumble AI solves**

Real work happens while you talk, listen, and move between tasks. That is also where most things get lost. Mumble keeps your ideas, conversations, and people organized automatically so you never lose momentum:

- turns your voice into structured notes and builds your knowledge base as you speak
- produces clean summaries even for long meeting sessions
- speeds up thinking by letting you invoke the agent through a shortcut
- keeps your schedule organized so nothing falls through the cracks

**What you get**

- 5x faster capture
- hands free note-taking and management
- a growing memory bank for tasks and relationships
- an AI assistant that keeps your notes and tasks organized

We’re continuing to expand Mumble’s voice skills so you can manage your work end to end through conversation and stay organized
