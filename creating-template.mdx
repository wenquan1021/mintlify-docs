You can create a template in two different ways: with AI assistance or manually.

At the top of the template list on the left panel, you’ll see a + New Template button. Click it to choose between: Generating a template with AI and Creating one yourself.

- Select “Describe what you need” and tell Mumble what this template is for. You can describe the purpose, structure, or sections you would like to include.
- If you choose “Create manually”, you can:
  - Type directly into the editor
  - Use voice dictation shortcut to input content by talking
