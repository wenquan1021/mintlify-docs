## Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.
</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hidden pages

MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.
