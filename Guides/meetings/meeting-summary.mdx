title: "Meeting Summary"

After a meeting ends, Mumble helps you turn the conversation into a clear and useful summary. You can choose different templates, regenerate outputs, and export the results to share with others.

- Meeting summary template

  Inside the summary block, click Auto to open the template menu. You can select different templates to structure your meeting summary.

  Meeting summaries and notes share the same template library. If you want to create or edit templates, see the template guide here: Templates [link]
- Meeting output

  You can also choose different output templates to regenerate the meeting content. When you click “+ New output” and apply a new output template, the newly generated content appears below the existing summary. The original content is not overwritten, so you can compare different versions and keep what works best for you.
- Regenerate and export

  If you are not satisfied with the summary, click “Re-generate” in the top right corner to create a new version.

  To share or save your summary, click Export to export the content as a Google Doc. This makes it easy to send meeting notes to teammates or store them with your other documents.
