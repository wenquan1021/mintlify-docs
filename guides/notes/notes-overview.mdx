Notes are the core space in Mumble where you capture, organize, and revisit your thoughts. Whether you type, speak, or generate content with AI, everything lives in notes so it is easy to manage and edit later.

- Layout

  In the Notes view, the notes list appears on the left and the selected note opens on the right. At the top of the list, you can use filters to decide how notes are displayed, either sorted by last updated time or by creation time.

  If you click the 🌟 icon in the top right of a note, it will be added to your favorites. You can quickly find all starred notes in “🌟 Favorites”.

  When you create Smart Note rules and turn “Smart Notes” on, notes that match those rules will be automatically organized. You can view them anytime in “Smart Notes”. 
- Note types: text note, voice note

  Mumble supports two main types of notes: text notes and voice notes. You can edit notes by typing directly, or by clicking the “+” on the left to add different blocks.
  - For quick capture, hold option to start voice dictation. What you say will be transcribed into text and appear directly in your note.
  - If you want to keep the original recording, press “option” + “space” to create a voice note block. In the voice note panel:

    Click the down arrow to move the block into a new note

    Click the up arrow to keep the block in the current note

    The difference between voice dictation and voice notes is dictation only turns speech into text, but voice notes keep the original audio and transcript, and let you apply templates or regenerate structured content
- Basic actions
  - Create a note Click the “+” next to Notes and select New note. You will see a blank note. The note is saved only after you add a title or content.
  - Create a voice note Click the “+” next to Notes and select New voice note. This opens the same voice note panel as pressing option + space.
  - Voice edit Select the part of the note you want to change, hold option, and say what you want it to become. Mumble will update the text for you.
