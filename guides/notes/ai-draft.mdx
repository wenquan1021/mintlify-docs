- What AI Draft does

  AI Draft lets you create content by talking to Mumble. You can generate emails, messages, summaries, or any written draft with just a short input or voice command. You do not need to write full sentences. Just tell Mumble what you want, and it will create a clean first draft for you.
- How to generate a draft

  Click the “+” under the note title and select AI Draft. Then talk to Mumble or type your request:
  - start with a short prompt
  - use voice input instead of typing
  - apply a template so Mumble generates content in a specific structure
- How to refine or regenerate content

  Here are several ways to refine an AI Draft:
  - Select the part you want to change and hold option to edit it using voice
  - Click “Edit with AI” in the top right and tell Mumble how to improve the content
  - Manually edit the text directly
  - Click “Re-generate” to create a new version of the draft
