Smart notes help you automatically organize messy notes into structured ones. You set the rules once, and Mumble takes care of the rest.

- Smart notes are designed to:
  - Automatically structure and organize your notes
  - Continuously collect related voice notes into a single organized note
- How to use
  - Set rules

    You can set rules in two ways:
    - Ask Mumble to generate rules for you
    - Create the rules yourself
  - Edit rules

    You have three ways to edit Rules:
    - You can click **"Edit with AI"** and describe the changes you want
    - You can manually add or remove rule details
    - You can select part of a rule and use voice edit by holding option
