Meetings help you capture conversations automatically and turn them into structured notes and summaries. In Mumble, you can manage upcoming meetings, review past ones, and take notes in real time without interrupting the flow of the conversation.

- Layout: meetings list, search, filters

  On the Meetings page, you will see a list of your upcoming meetings and meetings that have already finished. You can search meetings or use filters at the top of the page.

  For completed meetings, the filter lets you choose how they are sorted. You can view them by creation time or by last updated time, depending on how you prefer to organize your work.
- Meeting Detection
  - How Mumble identifies a meeting from your calendar

    Mumble can automatically detect meetings from your Google Calendar. When you have a meeting scheduled in Google Calendar, Mumble recognizes it and shows a pop up reminder before the meeting starts.
  - How auto-recording is triggered

    Auto Recording is now enabled by default. Once a meeting begins, Mumble will automatically start recording and stop when the meeting ends, so there is no need to manually start or stop anything.

    If you would like to turn it off, simply go to the Settings page and toggle off Auto Recording.
- Create upcoming meeting
  - Manually adding an upcoming meeting

    To add an upcoming meeting, click **"+ New upcoming meeting"**. When the meeting starts, click **"Start recording"** to begin capturing the conversation.
  - Editing meeting details

    On the upcoming meeting page, you can edit meeting details at any time. You can set the title, adjust the start time, add people, and apply a specific template. You can also sync the meeting to your Google Calendar if needed.
- During the Meeting
  - Layout: attendees, transcripts, meeting notes

    While the meeting is in progress, Mumble gives you a clear and focused layout.

    You can see the list of attendees, real time transcripts with speaker identification, and a blank input area where you can add your own notes as the meeting goes on. This lets you stay engaged in the conversation while Mumble handles the capture and structure for you.
