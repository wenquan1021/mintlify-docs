**Checklist**

When you first open the app, you’ll see a set of checklist cards at the top of the homepage. Each card highlights a core Mumble AI feature. These checklist items will stay visible until you complete them, so you can explore each feature at your own pace.

You can hover over a card to preview a quick demo of the task, and click the button on the card to follow the on-screen guidance and try the feature yourself.

**Kanban**

The homepage is organized into three main blocks:

- In Progress

  This is where you’ll see notes being generated, meeting summaries in progress, and active tasks.
- Decision Requests

  If Mumble needs more context to continue a task, it will appear in Decision Requests. You can click the task card and reply by voice, and Mumble will continue based on your instructions.
- Done

  Once a task, note, or summary is completed, it moves to Done. Click a card to review how Mumble completed the task, or jump directly to the related note or meeting summary
