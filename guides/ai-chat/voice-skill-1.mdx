Mumble can help you schedule events using your voice and automatically sync them to your Google Calendar. You can create and reschedule events hands-free, without switching tools or typing.

**How to use Event Scheduling**

- Hold “option” + “space” to trigger global callout. As you speak, Mumble automatically detects the right voice skill, or you can select “Schedule” from the Voice skill on the Home page.

- Tell Mumble what event you want to schedule

  Mention the time, duration, and participants for the event

  Mumble can schedule and reschedule events for you, but canceling events by voice isn’t supported yet.
