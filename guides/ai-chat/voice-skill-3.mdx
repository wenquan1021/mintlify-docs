This skill combines Skill 1 and Skill 2, allowing Mumble to schedule an event and send a message to your WhatsApp contact at the same time.

To use this voice skill, you can either press “option” + “space” and speak naturally, letting Mumble decide which skill to use, or select “Schedule and Message” from the Voice skill menu.
