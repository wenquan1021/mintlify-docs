Mumble is more than a voice dictation tool. It understands what you want to do, generates content, manages your calendar and contacts, and helps you stay organized while thinking faster across your workspace.

Mumble can:

- manage tasks, contacts, and notes directly inside the app
- draft content based on your instructions
- answer questions to help you plan, brainstorm, and clarify ideas
- turn your voice comments into structured outputs whenever you need them

Mumble grows with your workflow and is always ready to help you get things done!
